# Lightning talk for Engmeetup 2017

For the Joyent 2017 engineering meetup, I gave
[a lightning talk](https://youtu.be/XW-RQ3cclXs) on
[Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/), a tool that has been in my personal
toolbox for over two decades.

This repository contains the three data sets used for the talk, all 
generated with [toshstomp](https://github.com/joyent/toshstomp):

- toshstomp.sd17.out, toshstomp.sd18.out and toshstomp.sd14.out contain
  toshstomp data from three different drives from three different vendors

- sd17.io.in, sd18.io.in and sd14.io.in contain [iostat](http://illumos.org/man/1m/iostat)-based write operation per-second data from the same devices from the same workload
